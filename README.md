## Description:

#

## [_NoteTakerPlus_](https://hw-notetakerplus.herokuapp.com/notes) is an application designed to let users input personalized notes and information, then save them to an easy to read list for the user to see. Our application uses an Express.js back end and retrieves note data from a JSON file. Users will be brought to our "landing page" and be able to follow the link attached to a buttton which will direct them to a "notes taking page" with input fields. In the upper right corner users will be able to select new notes and when they input text into the notes fields then a save button will become visible for the user to save their note.
